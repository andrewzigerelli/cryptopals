the cryptopals challenges

i'm going to attempt to do this in python so I "get it" and finally become one
of those millions who love python

cryptopals recommends working on 'raw bytes', but python's bytes type sucks. you
can't even xor two bytes together. so, i instead work on strings, and I convert
an "ascii string" to a "hex string" using functions in helper.py. "hex strings"
are my raw bytes.
